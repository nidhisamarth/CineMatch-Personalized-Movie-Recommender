# Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering

This Python script implements a content-based movie recommendation system using the IMDb dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, text processing, and feature extraction to create a recommendation model. The primary steps include:

1. **Data Loading and Selection:**
   - The IMDb dataset is loaded using Pandas from a CSV file.
   - Relevant columns (Series_Title, Genre, Overview, Director, Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4) are selected for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Text Processing:**
   - Text data in selected columns is converted to lowercase for consistency.
   - Spaces are removed from columns like 'Director', 'Star1', 'Star2', 'Star3', 'Star4'.
   - The 'Overview' column is split into a list of words.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Each word in 'Director', 'Star1', 'Star2', 'Star3', 'Star4', 'Genre', and 'Overview' is converted to lowercase.
   - Lists from these columns are combined into a new column 'Tags'.
   - Redundant columns are dropped.

4. **Text Stemming:**
   - Porter stemming is applied to the 'Tags' column to reduce words to their root form.

5. **Feature Extraction using CountVectorizer:**
   - The CountVectorizer is utilized to convert the 'Tags' column into a matrix of token counts.
   - The matrix is limited to 4000 features, and English stop words are removed.

6. **Cosine Similarity Calculation:**
   - Cosine similarity is computed between movies based on the extracted features.

7. **Movie Recommendation Function:**
   - The 'recommend' function takes a movie title as input, finds its index, and calculates cosine similarity with other movies.
   - It then prints the top 5 recommended movies based on similarity.

8. **Example Recommendation:**
   - An example recommendation is provided for the movie 'The Dark Knight'.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK) are installed.
3. Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
