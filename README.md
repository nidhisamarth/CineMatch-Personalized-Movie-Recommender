This Python script implements a content-based movie recommendation system using the IMDb dataset. The project involves steps such as data preprocessing, text transformation, and feature extraction to build a recommendation engine. Below is an overview of the process:

1. Data Loading and Selection
The IMDb dataset is loaded using Pandas from a CSV file.

Key columns are selected for analysis: Series_Title, Genre, Overview, Director, Star1, Star2, Star3, and Star4.

2. Data Cleaning and Text Processing
All text data is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

Spaces are removed from columns like Director and cast member names (Star1 to Star4).

The Overview text is tokenized into a list of words.

3. Feature Engineering
Text from Director, cast, Genre, and Overview columns is processed and converted to lowercase.

These elements are merged into a single column called Tags.

Redundant columns are removed for simplicity.

4. Text Stemming
Porter Stemmer is applied to the Tags column to reduce words to their base or root form, enhancing similarity detection.

5. Feature Extraction with CountVectorizer
The Tags column is transformed into a numerical feature matrix using CountVectorizer.

The vectorizer is limited to the top 4000 most frequent words and removes common English stop words.

6. Cosine Similarity Computation
Cosine similarity is calculated across all movies based on their feature vectors to measure content similarity.

7. Movie Recommendation Function
A function named recommend() is created. It:

Takes a movie title as input.

Finds its index and computes cosine similarity with all other movies.

Returns the top 5 most similar movie recommendations.

8. Example
A sample recommendation is demonstrated for the movie "The Dark Knight".

How to Use
Clone the repository.

Make sure Python is installed along with the necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK).

Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment of your choice.
